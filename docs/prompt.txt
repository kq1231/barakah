We have successfully completed the user interface development. Now we need to integrate the business logic, which involves database communication. In our case, we are using ObjectBox as our database solution. Fortunately, we have already created the necessary entities for ObjectBox. An entity essentially functions as a table with a defined schema, where fields represent columns in the table, similar to SQL architecture.

When developing with Language Learning Models (LLMs), we follow a UI-first approach. Initially, we plan the entire application to determine desired features. Subsequently, we create data models, such as ObjectBox entities or SQL tables, before proceeding to UI development. It is crucial to establish the UI first to understand the application's look and feel, allowing for adjustments during the development process. Since user interaction occurs primarily through the interface, having a tangible UI significantly simplifies the development of repositories and business logic components while reducing potential bugs.

Previously, I followed a different methodology—creating models, repositories, providers, controllers, and finally the UI. However, this approach proved problematic as I would often lose sight of the project's objectives without a visual reference, resulting in suboptimal applications. The current approach has proven much more effective.

With the UI now complete, our plan is to integrate business logic and implement one feature daily. Today's focus is on the accounts feature, implementing all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This includes creating new accounts, viewing accounts, checking balances, and reconciliation capabilities. I aim to complete this today, as consistent daily development is beneficial. There is no urgency, but maintaining steady progress is important.

To proceed, you should examine the accounts UI and the accounts model in the models folder to understand our objectives. For additional context, refer to the documentation in the docs folder, particularly the plan and UI implementation plan markdown files, which outline our planning process.

The first step is creating a repository using an AsyncNotifier from Riverpod to facilitate communication with ObjectBox. Before that, we need to establish an ObjectBox store, which serves as our database access point. We must create a store provider—a FutureProvider that can be initialized and loaded with the store. Since this process is asynchronous and the application depends entirely on the store, initialization must occur in the main method.

One approach is to use the .future syntax on the provider to access and await the future, thereby initializing the provider. However, a more robust method would be to create a comprehensive initialization flow with Riverpod by developing an app startup provider (another FutureProvider) and corresponding UI screens for loading, resolution, and error states, all managed through Riverpod. I will provide references for this Riverpod app initialization process.
